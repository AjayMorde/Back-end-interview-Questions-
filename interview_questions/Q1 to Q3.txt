question 1


In JavaScript, let, const, and var are keywords used to store variables. They differ in their scopes
var -Has global or function scope.

If you store or initialize a value using var, it may be redeclared multiple times in the same scope.let

Has block scope, which means it's limited to the curly braces {} where it's defined.

You can't redeclare a variable using let in the same scope, but you can assign a new value.



const

Also has block scope.

You can neither redeclare nor reassign a value once it's set.
