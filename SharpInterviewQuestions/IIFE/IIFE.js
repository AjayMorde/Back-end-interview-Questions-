//  One of the main benefits of using an IIFE is to encapsulate code and prevent variable and function 
//  name collisions with other scripts. It helps in maintaining a clean and modular codebase. Additionally,
//   variables declared inside an IIFE are not accessible from the outside, which can enhance security and prevent
//   unintended modification of variables.
